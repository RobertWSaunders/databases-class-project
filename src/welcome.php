	<h1>Welcome, grab some popcorn and enjoy the show!</h1>
	<br />
	<p>This is the simplest online movie ticketing sytem in the world, search for movies you want to see and reserve your spot now. Did you know that the world consumes over 1 trillion pounds of popcorn in a single day. Also, did you know that OJ Simpson almost played the Terminator? Or did you know that the sound of the velociraptors communicating with each other in Jurassic Park is actually the sound of tortoises mating. You learn something new everyday, enjoy and watch responsibly.</p>
